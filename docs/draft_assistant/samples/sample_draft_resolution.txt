The General Assembly,

Noting with deep concern that the number of forcibly displaced persons worldwide has exceeded 110 million people as of 2023, representing the highest level ever recorded,

Recalling the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol as the cornerstone of international refugee protection,

Reaffirming the Global Compact on Refugees adopted in 2018, which promotes international cooperation and more equitable responsibility-sharing,

Recognizing that 73% of refugees are hosted by developing countries and least developed countries, creating disproportionate burdens on these nations,

Deeply concerned about the protracted nature of displacement, with the average duration of exile now exceeding 20 years,

Bearing in mind that education access for refugee children remains critically low, with only 68% enrolled in primary education and 37% in secondary education,

Observing the economic potential of refugees when provided with work rights and integration opportunities, contributing significantly to host economies,

Alarmed by increasing incidents of xenophobia, discrimination, and violence against refugees and asylum seekers in multiple regions,

Emphasizing the root causes of forced displacement, including armed conflict, persecution, human rights violations, climate change, and extreme poverty,

Conscious of the particular vulnerabilities faced by refugee women, children, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities,

Acknowledging successful integration models in countries such as Canada, Germany, and Uganda that have demonstrated effective refugee inclusion,

1. Establishes the Global Refugee Response Fund with an initial target of $10 billion annually, to be funded through:
   a) Assessed contributions from member states based on GDP,
   b) Voluntary contributions from private sector and philanthropic organizations,
   c) Innovative financing mechanisms including refugee bonds;

2. Calls upon all member states to implement comprehensive refugee integration policies that include:
   a) Recognition of educational credentials and professional qualifications within six months of arrival,
   b) Right to work permits issued within three months of refugee status determination,
   c) Access to national healthcare and social protection systems equivalent to citizens,
   d) Language and skills training programs beginning within 30 days of arrival;

3. Urges the establishment of Regional Refugee Responsibility-Sharing Mechanisms in five major displacement regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, South Asia, Central America, Eastern Europe) by 2026 to coordinate burden-sharing among neighboring states;

4. Recommends expanding refugee resettlement commitments to reach a global target of 500,000 annual resettlement places by 2028, with equitable distribution among developed nations based on population and GDP capacity;

5. Requests the creation of an Education Cannot Wait Fund specifically for refugees, with $2 billion allocated over five years to ensure universal primary and secondary education access for all refugee children;

6. Encourages member states to adopt the "whole-of-society" approach involving local governments, civil society organizations, private sector, and refugee communities in planning and implementing integration programs;

7. Calls for strengthened protection mechanisms including:
   a) Expedited family reunification procedures completed within six months,
   b) Enhanced safeguards against sexual and gender-based violence in refugee settings,
   c) Specialized support services for unaccompanied minors and separated children,
   d) Mental health and psychosocial support programs in all refugee hosting areas;

8. Urges increased investment in conflict prevention, peacebuilding, and sustainable development in countries of origin to address root causes of displacement, with annual funding of at least $5 billion;

9. Recommends development of climate-induced displacement protocols recognizing environmental factors as legitimate grounds for international protection when combined with other vulnerabilities;

10. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to establish a comprehensive data collection and monitoring system tracking:
    a) Refugee demographics and location patterns,
    b) Integration outcomes including employment rates and education enrollment,
    c) Host community socioeconomic impacts,
    d) Protection incidents and human rights violations;

11. Encourages bilateral and multilateral safe and legal pathways for refugees including:
    a) Expanded humanitarian visa programs,
    b) Private sponsorship schemes modeled on successful Canadian experience,
    c) Labor mobility programs matching refugee skills with market demands,
    d) Academic scholarship opportunities for refugee youth;

12. Supports technology innovation in refugee response including:
    a) Digital identity systems for documentation and services access,
    b) Mobile applications for service delivery and information sharing,
    c) Blockchain solutions for transparent aid distribution,
    d) Remote learning platforms for education continuity;

13. Calls upon media organizations and civil society to promote positive narratives about refugees, combating misinformation and xenophobia through evidence-based reporting and public awareness campaigns;

14. Requests the establishment of a High-Level Panel on Forced Displacement comprising heads of state, refugee representatives, academics, and civil society leaders to conduct comprehensive policy reviews and propose innovations in refugee protection;

15. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter and requests the Secretary-General to submit annual progress reports on implementation of this resolution.
