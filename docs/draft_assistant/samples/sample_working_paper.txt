Preamble:

Noting with grave concern that approximately 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the world's oceans annually,

Recalling the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992,

Recognizing that plastic pollution disproportionately affects developing nations and small island states,

Observing that current recycling infrastructure proves insufficient in 95% of developing countries,

Bearing in mind the economic losses to fisheries and tourism sectors exceeding $13 billion annually,

Deeply concerned about microplastic contamination in marine food chains and human health impacts,

Affirming the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in environmental protection,

Acknowledging successful regional initiatives such as the European Union's Single-Use Plastics Directive,

Operative Section:

1. Recommends the establishment of a Global Plastic Waste Management Fund with initial capitalization of $5 billion from developed nations to support developing countries in building recycling infrastructure;

2. Urges all member states to implement extended producer responsibility schemes requiring manufacturers to finance 75% of packaging waste collection and recycling costs by 2028;

3. Calls upon coastal nations to develop National Marine Debris Action Plans within 18 months, including:
   a) Baseline assessments of plastic pollution levels,
   b) Source identification and reduction targets,
   c) Clean-up and remediation strategies,
   d) Public awareness campaigns;

4. Encourages the phase-out of single-use plastics in government operations by 2026, prioritizing items such as bags, straws, and utensils;

5. Requests the creation of an International Plastic Pollution Monitoring Network coordinated by UNEP to track pollution flows and measure progress against reduction targets;

6. Supports investment in research and development of biodegradable alternatives to conventional plastics, with funding allocation of $500 million over five years;

7. Recommends establishing minimum recycled content standards requiring consumer products to contain at least 30% recycled plastic by 2030;

8. Calls for strengthened enforcement of the Basel Convention on hazardous waste transboundary movement, particularly preventing illegal dumping in developing nations;

9. Encourages public-private partnerships to develop innovative waste collection systems in coastal communities and river systems that discharge into oceans;

10. Requests annual progress reports to be submitted to the UNEP Governing Council tracking implementation of these measures and their environmental impact.
