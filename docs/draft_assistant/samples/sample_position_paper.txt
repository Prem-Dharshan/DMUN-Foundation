Topic: Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament

Introduction

The proliferation of nuclear weapons remains one of the most critical threats to international peace and security. Since the establishment of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1970, the international community has made significant strides toward preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. However, recent developments, including emerging nuclear states and modernization programs by existing nuclear powers, have created new challenges that require immediate and coordinated international action.

Japan's Position

As the only nation to have experienced the devastating effects of nuclear weapons in wartime, Japan maintains an unwavering commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament. Our government firmly believes that the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances is unacceptable and poses an existential threat to humanity. Japan's Three Non-Nuclear Principles—not possessing, not producing, and not permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japanese territory—form the cornerstone of our foreign policy. We advocate for strengthening the NPT regime, promoting universal adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and advancing negotiations toward a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT).

Past Actions and International Cooperation

Japan has consistently played a leading role in nuclear disarmament efforts at the United Nations. In 2020, Japan co-sponsored Resolution 75/45 calling for renewed commitment to the NPT framework. Our government has also provided substantial financial support to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system, contributing over $50 million annually to strengthen verification mechanisms. Additionally, Japan hosts the annual Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony, bringing together world leaders, survivors, and youth advocates to maintain global awareness of nuclear weapons' humanitarian consequences. Through the Japan-IAEA Joint Nuclear Energy Management School, we have trained over 500 professionals from developing nations in nuclear safety and security protocols.

Proposed Solutions

Japan proposes a comprehensive four-pillar approach to strengthen nuclear non-proliferation. First, we recommend establishing a dedicated UN verification and monitoring committee with enhanced authority to conduct surprise inspections and real-time surveillance of nuclear facilities worldwide. This committee should operate with a budget of $200 million annually, funded through assessed contributions from member states. Second, we advocate for a moratorium on all nuclear weapons testing and the development of new delivery systems, with violations resulting in automatic economic sanctions coordinated through the Security Council. Third, Japan proposes creating a Nuclear Disarmament Education Fund of $100 million to support educational programs in schools worldwide, ensuring future generations understand the humanitarian imperative of nuclear abolition. Fourth, we call for immediate negotiations to expand the CTBT signatories, with a target of universal ratification by 2030, supported by technical assistance for developing national seismic monitoring networks.

Implementation and Timeline

These proposals should be implemented through a phased approach over five years. The verification committee should be established within twelve months, with initial operations focused on known nuclear states and facilities. The testing moratorium should take effect immediately upon adoption, with a six-month grace period for states to bring existing programs into compliance. Educational programs should begin in pilot countries within eighteen months, scaling to global implementation by year three. Our government commits to providing $50 million in seed funding for these initiatives and pledges to host the inaugural conference for treaty negotiations in Tokyo.

Conclusion

Nuclear weapons represent an unacceptable threat to human civilization and our shared future. Japan stands ready to work with all member states, nuclear and non-nuclear alike, to build a world free from nuclear weapons. We urge the Security Council to adopt these concrete measures to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, enhance verification capabilities, and move decisively toward our common goal of nuclear disarmament. The time for action is now—we owe it to the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and to all future generations to eliminate nuclear weapons permanently. Japan calls upon this body to demonstrate the political will necessary to achieve lasting peace and security through effective nuclear non-proliferation.
