## 💡 Search Tips

### ✅ DO:

1. **Use general terms** for broader results

   - ✅ "program" → finds all programs
   - ✅ "leader" → finds all leadership content

2. **Try related words** if you don't find what you need

   - ✅ No results for "chairman"? Try "board" or "director"
   - ✅ No results for "contribute"? Try "donate" or "volunteer"

3. **Don't worry about spelling**

   - ✅ Type naturally - typos are handled automatically

4. **Use phrases** for specific content
   - ✅ "model united nations" → prioritizes MUN content
   - ✅ "youth leadership" → finds specific programs

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't use special characters**

   - ❌ "leader!" → use "leader"
   - ❌ "donate?" → use "donate"

2. **Don't use very short words**

   - ❌ "un" → too short (unless part of phrase)
   - ✅ "united nations" → better

3. **Don't use ALL CAPS** (not necessary)
   - ❌ "VOLUNTEER" → works same as "volunteer"
   - ✅ "volunteer" → cleaner
